  This is img2eps, a raster image to EPSF converter.

  img2eps packages raster images into EPS (Embedded PostScript) files,
using whatever PostScript features are advantageous.  If possible, the
compressed image data is copied directly to the EPS file.

  Supported image file formats are GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and XPM.

  For generic installation instructions, see file `INSTALL'; for
documentation read the man page; for internal documentation see the
documents in the doc subdirectory.
