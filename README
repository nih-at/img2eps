  This is img2eps, a raster image to EPSF converter.

  img2eps packages raster images into EPS (Embedded PostScript) files,
using whatever PostScript features are advantageous.  If possible, the
compressed image data is copied directly to the EPS file.

  Supported image file formats are GIF, JPEG, JPEG 2000, PNG, TIFF,
and XPM.

  For generic installation instructions, see file `INSTALL'; for
documentation read the man page; for internal documentation see the
documents in the doc subdirectory.

REQUIREMENTS:

  img2eps does not require the following packages, but certain
features will be omitted if they are missing:

  For image format support: libpng, jpeg, jasper, tiff, and either
giflib or libungif.

  For compression support: zlib (FlateEncode), jpeg (DCTEncode).

  img2eps's configure script only searches for these libraries in the
directories the compiler searches.  If you have them installed
elsewhere, pass CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to configure to make the compiler
find them.  For example, if you have the libraries installed in
/usr/local, the following should work:
	CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure
If your runtime linker needs to be told to search extra directories
too (img2eps will link in that case, but complain about missing
libraries when run), either of the following LDFLAGS settings should
work:
	LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib'
	LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-R/usr/local/lib'
(The first works on Solaris, the second on NetBSD.)
